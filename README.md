# Bird-classifier
this is a project where i finetuned the convolutional neural network, MobileNetV2 on the dataset CUB_200_2011<br>
after fine tuning the overall classification accuracy of the model is 95%

## CUB_200_2011
### about this dataset 
This is a dataset from caltech-UCSD obtained from kaggle. <br> 
Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200-2011) is an extended version of the CUB-200 dataset, with roughly double the number of images per class and new part location annotations. <br>
Number of categories: 200<br>
Number of images: 11,788<br>

## MobileNetV2 
My choice for using MobileNetV2 is due to its balance of efficiency and performance. Since the model is lightweight, it is well-suited for deployment on mobile devices, making it an ideal choice for applications where computational resources are limited. Additionally, MobileNetV2's streamlined architecture reduces memory usage and inference time, ensuring faster and more responsive applications. This scalability makes it particularly advantageous for integrating AI-powered features into mobile apps, providing users with seamless and real-time experiences.<br>
